# Millennium Falcon Standard Operating Procedures

_"She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts" - Official Fleet Manual_

## Pre-Flight Checklist

### Essential Systems

- [ ] Hyperdrive motivator: Give it a good kick and listen for concerning noises
- [ ] Navicomputer: Ensure R2 units have NOT been "improving" the calculations
- [ ] Landing gear: Check that Chewbacca hasn't been using hydraulic fluid as hair conditioner again
- [ ] Cockpit defroster: Mandatory for visibility and preventing frozen blue milk spills

### Emergency Equipment

- [ ] Thermal detonators: Count them. If any are missing, check Lando's pockets
- [ ] Emergency rations: Blue milk, nerf jerky, and whatever Chewie caught last week
- [ ] Medical supplies: Bacta patches and a really good explanation for the insurance company

## Hyperdrive Operations

### Standard Jump Procedure

1. Calculate jump coordinates (twice, because math is hard in space)
2. Warn passengers to secure loose items, pets, and Porgs
3. Say "Never tell me the odds" at least once
4. Hit the hyperdrive lever with confidence you don't actually feel
5. If nothing happens, refer to Section 7.2: "Percussive Maintenance"

### Emergency Procedures

- **If hyperdrive fails during Imperial pursuit**: Panic appropriately, then hide in asteroid field
- **If stuck in space slug**: Do NOT exit the ship for "fresh air"
- **If time travel occurs**: Avoid meeting yourself and resist urge to win podrace bets

## Passenger Safety Guidelines

### Boarding Procedures

- Wipe feet before entering (mud from Dagobah takes forever to clean)
- No smoking, especially if you're a protocol droid prone to short-circuiting
- Jedi are welcome but must stow lightsabers during turbulence
- Imperial officers require proper documentation and a really good reason

### In-Flight Conduct

- Keep hands and tentacles inside the ship during lightspeed
- The co-pilot seat is reserved for someone who can actually fly
- No force-choking fellow passengers, even if they're really annoying
- Chess table is off-limits during diplomatic missions (Wookiees are sore losers)

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily

- Check for new dents, burns, or mysterious alien attachments
- Oil Threepio (he gets cranky and talks more when rusty)
- Count escape pods (should always equal number of crew + 1 for emergencies)

### Weekly

- Defrost carbon freezing chamber (just in case)
- Update "Kessel Run" time on ship's registry (currently 12 parsecs, could be better)
- Remove Porg nests from air vents
- Test communications array by arguing with other ships

### Monthly

- Full hull inspection for smuggling compartments you forgot about
- Verify all blasters are set to "stun" (except Han's, obviously)
- Update navigation charts with new Imperial blockades and Death Star locations
- Schedule appointment with droid therapist for R2 units
